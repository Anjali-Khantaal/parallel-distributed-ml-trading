# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of distributed and parallel computing frameworks to implement a basic algorithmic trading system. The goal is to build a minimal, end-to-end trading pipelineâ€”from data preparation to distributed model training and backtesting.

Using tools like Apache Spark, Dask, or Ray, the project highlights how distributed computing can enhance the efficiency of machine learning workflows, particularly in the context of financial data analysis.

## Features

- Distributed Data Processing using the `Dask` framework.
- Train Machine Learning model --- `Random Forest` on historical market data.
- Simulate trade using model predictions.
- Backtest and assess performance using key matrices like ---
- Modular codebase for efficient data handling, trading, and strategy implementation.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains raw or prepared datasets, including historical price data (e.g., `historical_prices.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the workflow:
  - `1_data_preparation.ipynb`: Data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering.
  - `2_distributed_training.ipynb`: Distributed model training using frameworks like Dask or Spark.
  - `3_backtesting_and_evaluation.ipynb`: Simulating trades and evaluating strategy performance.
- **`src/`**: Python scripts for core functionality:
  - `data_loader.py`: Loads data for processing and analysis.
  - `distributed_training.py`: Implements distributed model training.
  - `trading_strategy.py`: Defines trading logic and generates buy/sell signals.
  - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions to support other modules.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`Dockerfile`**: (Optional) Enables containerization for reproducibility and ease of deployment.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).
- **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the open-source license for the repository.
